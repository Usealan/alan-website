        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Names in a spreadsheet don't pay the bills for your clients, unless they show up to an initial introductory discussion to get to know them and their business. Unfortunately, less than 10% of leads ever make it to this step which represents one of the highest ROI improvements a service business can generate.</p>

        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>ALAN automates the process of getting leads to show up for appointments, leveraging cutting edge data science to identify patterns and customize messaging to increase likelihood the prospect will show.</p>
        <p>It replaces the need to hire, train, coach, manage, and pay someone to fulfill the same function - and it never takes a day off or calls in sick.</p>
        <p>ALAN offers each user cost savings as a baseline with upside of potential out-performance as evidenced to date (30%+ lead to show rates).</p>
