        <h2>Manifesto</h2>
        <p>ALAN stands for <strong>A</strong>rtificial <strong>L</strong>ead <strong>A</strong>utomation & <strong>N</strong>urture.</p>
        <p>ALAN was designed to solve one of the most significant failure points in a premium-positioned health services business - that names in a spreadsheet don't pay your bills... unless they show up to an initial introductory discussion to get to know you and your business. Unfortunately, less than 10% of leads ever make it to this step which represents one of the highest ROI improvements a service business can generate.</p>
        <p>If you could increase your sales without spending more on advertising or upgrading your team's skills, would it change the health of your business?</p>
        <p>ALAN delivers on a single, but powerful, objective - to increase the number of people who "walk through your door" (in-person or virtually) ready to buy.</p>
        <p>Automated customized and personalized campaigns developed by some of the top client acquisition experts in the country.</p>
        <p>Omnichannel platform which blends the ease of FB Messenger with higher engagement levels seen with SMS (vs. email).</p>
        <p>Leverage cutting edge data science to identify patterns and customize messaging to increase likelihood the prospect will show.</p>
        <p>Replaces the need to hire, train, coach, manage, and pay someone to fulfill the same function - and it never takes a day off or calls in sick.</p>
        <p>ALAN offers each user cost savings as a baseline with upside of potential out-performance as evidenced to date (30%+ lead to show rates).</p>
        <p>So good that marketing agencies have easily implemented ALAN as a new revenue stream which helps deliver value to their clients and competitive moat for themselves.</p>
        <p>Also, included with ALAN is some of the best and time-tested sales training on the market to help you close those leads at a higher avg sale ($650+ up front) and turn them into long term customers.</p>
