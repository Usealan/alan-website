    <p>1. Introduction</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes the information and data collection, storage, and use practices and policies of ALAN Deep Learning Inc (“USE ALAN,” “ALAN,” “we,” “our,” “us”) on the website at USEALAN.com (along with all sub-domains, collectively, the “Website”). This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Website and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from the Website, each of which may have data collection, storage, and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy. When you leave the Website via a link to another website, you are subject to that site’s Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, and other policies (“Third Party website policies”) applicable to that site and you should review the Third Party website policies.</p>
    <p>2. Information Collection and Use Practices</p>
    <p>i. Types of Information Collected USEALAN may collect two different types of information, Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) and Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”). PII and Non-PII may be collected anytime you access or use a USEALAN website, including this Website. PII and Non-PII may also be collected by USEALAN during in-person discussions, telephone conversations, and electronic or other written communications.</p>
    <p>Personally Identifiable Information Collected:</p>
    <p>In order for you to access and use the services offered through the Websites, we may require you to provide information that identifies you as an individual ( i.e. , “PII”). PII may include the following categories of information: (1) Contact Data (such as your name, mailing address, email address, and phone number(s)); (2) Financial Data (such as your account or credit card number); and (3) Demographic Data (such as your zip code and age). If you communicate with us by email, post messages to any of our chat groups, bulletin boards, or forums, or otherwise complete online forms or surveys, any information provided may be collected as PII.</p>
    <p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information Collected : We may automatically track and collect the following categories of information when you visit our Website: (1) IP addresses; (2) domain servers; (3) types of computers accessing the Website; and (4) types of web browsers used to access the Website (collectively “Non-PII”). Non-PII is anonymous information that does not personally identify you but is helpful for improving your experience on the Website.</p>
    <p>ii. Uses of Information Collected</p>
    <p>USEALAN uses PII to respond to your inquiries, provide you with services you have requested, keep you informed of services and products USEALAN thinks may be of interest to you, and otherwise personalize your experience with USEALAN, among other reasons. USEALAN does not sell or lease PII about you to others.<br>

    <p>USEALAN does not use cookies, web beacons, or clear gifs to collect or store any PII.</p>
    <p>IV. Sharing of Personal Information</p>
    <p>USEALAN may share PII with USEALAN affiliates, advertisers, and third parties contracting with USEALAN to provide services to you. The other parties with whom we share PII may send information to you about other products or services. We do not share your Financial Data with these third parties. We may share Financial Data with business partners who assist us by performing core services (such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, or data storage and security) related to our operation of the Website and provision of services. Those business partners agree to uphold the same standards of security and confidentiality described in this Privacy Policy, and they will only use your Financial Data to carry out their specific business obligations to USEALAN.</p>
    <p>If you do not want us to share your PII with any third parties, please email us at itsystems@USEALAN.com</p>
    <p>If we or some or all of our assets are acquired by another company, including through a sale in connection with a bankruptcy, that company will possess the information collected by us, and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your PII as described in this Privacy Policy. We may disclose PII or other data to comply with the law or legal requirements, enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements, or protect our rights, property, the safety of our users, or others.</p>
    <p>Because Non-PII does not personally identify You, USEALAN reserves the right to use and disclose to third parties Non-PII for any purpose.</p>
    <p>V. Interest-Based Ads</p>
    <p>We may also may share Non-PII with advertisers and other third parties who may use it for advertising purposes, including to serve targeted advertising on non-affiliated third party sites. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information about your online activities on the Website or other websites over time. For example, anonymous information collected across multiple sites may enable the ad network to predict your preferences and show you ads that are likely to be of interest to you. Please note that we do not share any information that identifies you personally with the third party service providers who serve ads on our behalf. To opt out of these types of ads, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) for information about how to opt-out of interest-based advertising by their members.
